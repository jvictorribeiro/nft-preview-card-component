### What I learned

I used this project to learn about tailwind, it was really fun to use utility classes to style the component and i think it made the development faster.

```html
<div class="relative">
    <img class="rounded-xl w-64 self-center" src="/images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium Image">
    <div class="rounded-xl opacity-0 hover:opacity-75 duration-300 absolute inset-0 w-54 h-54 z-10 text-white hover:bg-[#00fff7]">
        <img class="absolute inset-0 top-20 left-20" src="/images/icon-view.svg" alt="icon view">
    </div>
</div>
```
